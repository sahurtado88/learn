# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a vast system with many components and features. Here are the top areas of Kubernetes that are essential to learn for most use cases, and mastering them will likely yield 80% of the desired results:

Pods: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, and understanding how they work is fundamental to working with Kubernetes.

Deployments: Deployments are used to manage the desired state of the application running in a pod. Understanding how to create and manage deployments is essential.

Services: Services provide a stable IP address and DNS name for a set of pods. Understanding how to expose a deployment as a service is crucial for making an application accessible.

ConfigMaps: ConfigMaps provide a way to store configuration data separately from the pod's image. Understanding how to create and manage ConfigMaps is crucial for configuring an application.

Secrets: Secrets provide a way to store sensitive data, such as passwords or keys, separately from the pod's image. Understanding how to create and manage Secrets is crucial for managing sensitive information.

Persistent Volumes: Persistent Volumes provide a way to store data that persists beyond the lifetime of a pod. Understanding how to create and manage Persistent Volumes is essential for managing data in Kubernetes.

StatefulSets: StatefulSets provide a way to manage stateful applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage. Understanding how to create and manage StatefulSets is essential for running stateful applications in Kubernetes.

Namespaces: Namespaces provide a way to logically separate resources in a cluster. Understanding how to create and manage Namespaces is essential for managing resources in a large cluster.

Labels and Selectors: Labels and Selectors provide a way to group resources and select subsets of resources based on their attributes. Understanding how to use Labels and Selectors is crucial for managing resources in Kubernetes.

RBAC: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) provides a way to control access to resources based on roles and permissions. Understanding how to create and manage RBAC rules is essential for securing a Kubernetes cluster.

To master these areas of Kubernetes, here is a focused learning plan:

Start with the official Kubernetes documentation and tutorials to get a high-level understanding of Kubernetes and its core components.

Learn how to install and set up a Kubernetes cluster locally, using a tool like Minikube or Kind.

Start with Pods and Deployments, learn how to create and manage them, and understand how to use them to manage the state of your application.

Learn how to create and manage Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets to expose and configure your application.

Understand how to use Persistent Volumes and StatefulSets to manage stateful applications.

Learn how to use Namespaces, Labels, and Selectors to organize and manage resources in your cluster.

Finally, learn how to use RBAC to control access to resources in your cluster.

It's essential to practice what you learn by setting up test environments and experimenting with Kubernetes features. You can also find additional resources, such as online courses or books, to further deepen your understanding of Kubernetes.

# Ansible

# Docker

# Terraform

Terraform is a tool used for infrastructure as code, and it provides a simple and effective way to automate the creation and management of infrastructure resources. Here are the top areas of Terraform that are essential to learn for most use cases, and mastering them will likely yield 80% of the desired results:

Providers: Providers are plugins that interface with APIs of cloud providers, like AWS or Google Cloud. Understanding how to configure and use providers is fundamental to using Terraform.

Resources: Resources are the building blocks of infrastructure in Terraform, representing an infrastructure component such as an instance or load balancer. Understanding how to define and manage resources is essential.

Variables: Variables allow you to parameterize your infrastructure and make your Terraform code more flexible. Understanding how to define and use variables is essential for creating reusable and maintainable infrastructure code.

Outputs: Outputs allow you to define values that can be retrieved from Terraform after the infrastructure is created. Understanding how to define and use outputs is crucial for integrating Terraform with other tools and systems.

Modules: Modules are reusable code blocks that can be composed to create larger infrastructure configurations. Understanding how to create and use modules is essential for building scalable and maintainable infrastructure.

State: Terraform state is the information about the resources and their dependencies that Terraform stores and manages. Understanding how to manage and work with state is critical to using Terraform effectively and safely.

To master these areas of Terraform, here is a focused learning plan:

Start with the official Terraform documentation and tutorials to get a high-level understanding of Terraform and its core components.

Learn how to install and configure Terraform on your local machine.

Start with Providers, learn how to configure and use them, and understand how to authenticate and manage cloud resources.

Learn how to define Resources, including how to set their properties, and how to manage dependencies between resources.

Understand how to use Variables and Outputs to parameterize your code and retrieve values after deployment.

Learn how to use Modules to create reusable and composable infrastructure code.

Finally, learn how to work with Terraform State, including how to manage state files and how to perform common state-related tasks such as state migration.

It's essential to practice what you learn by creating test environments and experimenting with Terraform features. You can also find additional resources, such as online courses or books, to further deepen your understanding of Terraform.

# ArgoCD

ArgoCD is a popular tool for managing continuous delivery and deployment pipelines for Kubernetes applications. Here are the top areas of ArgoCD that are essential to learn for most use cases, and mastering them will likely yield 80% of the desired results:

Applications: Applications are the primary way of organizing and deploying Kubernetes resources in ArgoCD. Understanding how to create, manage, and deploy applications is fundamental to using ArgoCD.

Projects: Projects are a way of grouping applications, resources, and policies within ArgoCD. Understanding how to create and manage projects is essential for organizing and securing your deployment pipelines.

Sync: Syncing is the process of comparing the desired state of resources with the actual state in the cluster and making necessary changes. Understanding how to perform and customize syncing is critical for managing the deployment pipeline.

Rollouts: Rollouts are the process of updating and deploying new versions of your applications. Understanding how to configure and manage rollouts is essential for managing continuous deployment.

RBAC: Role-based access control (RBAC) is a way of controlling access to ArgoCD and its resources. Understanding how to configure and manage RBAC is crucial for securing and managing access to the deployment pipeline.

To master these areas of ArgoCD, here is a focused learning plan:

Start with the official ArgoCD documentation and tutorials to get a high-level understanding of ArgoCD and its core components.

Learn how to install and configure ArgoCD on your Kubernetes cluster.

Start with Applications, learn how to create, manage, and deploy them, and understand how to use advanced features such as hooks and rollouts.

Understand how to use Projects to organize and secure your deployment pipelines.
