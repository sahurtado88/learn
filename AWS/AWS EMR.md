# Amazon EMR

 Amazon EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing vast amounts of data using open source tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto. Amazon EMR uses Hadoop, an open-source framework, to distribute your data and processing across a resizable cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. EMR does not offer the same storage and processing speed as FSx for Lustre. So it is not the right fit for the given high-performance workflow scenario.
