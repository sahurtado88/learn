11: How do Amazon S3 transfer acceleration and Amazon CloudFront differ in terms of content delivery?

Answer: Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is specifically designed to speed up transferring files to and from Amazon S3 by utilizing Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. When users upload or download files, the data will travel through the optimized network path to reach the S3 bucket faster. On the other hand, Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches content in edge locations around the world, bringing the content closer to the end-users and reducing latency. While both involve CloudFront’s edge locations, S3 Transfer Acceleration is for faster transfers to S3, and CloudFront is for general content distribution to end-users.

12. What are placement groups in EC2, and can you describe the different types?

Answer: Placement groups are a way of controlling how EC2 instances are physically located relative to one another. There are three types:

Cluster Placement Groups: Used for applications needing low network latency and high network throughput, ensuring instances are placed in a single availability zone.

Spread Placement Groups: Ensures that instances are placed on distinct underlying hardware, reducing correlated failures and suitable for a small number of critical instances.

Partition Placement Groups: Spread instances across different partitions, ensuring that instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with instances in other partitions.

13. Describe AWS Organizations and its primary use cases. How does it help in managing multiple AWS accounts?

Primary use cases include centralized billing, setting up and managing accounts, applying and managing service control policies across accounts, and creating a hierarchical, multi-account structure. AWS Organizations simplifies billing for multiple accounts by enabling the setup of a single payment method for all the accounts in your organization through consolidated billing.

14. How would you design a multi-region architecture for high availability on AWS?

Answer: Designing a multi-region architecture involves replicating data and applications in more than one geographic region. This is achieved by setting up application stacks in multiple AWS regions, utilizing Amazon Route 53 for geo-based routing, replicating data using services like Amazon RDS cross-region replication or S3 Cross-Region Replication, and ensuring stateless applications to quickly scale and replicate.

15. What is the difference between an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and a Network Load Balancer (NLB)? When would you choose one over the other?

Answer: ALB is layer 7 (application layer) load balancer, suitable for routing user traffic based on content type, path, or host in the request. It’s ideal for HTTP/HTTPS traffic. NLB operates at layer 4 (transport layer) and is designed for TCP/UDP traffic where extreme performance is required. NLB is chosen for ultra-high levels of traffic or when low-level routing is necessary.

16. Explain the process of automating infrastructure deployment using AWS CloudFormation. What are CloudFormation templates?

Answer: AWS CloudFormation automates and simplifies the task of repeatedly and predictably creating groups of related resources that power your applications. The process involves writing a CloudFormation template in JSON or YAML format. This template defines the AWS resources you want to deploy. Once the template is created, you can use CloudFormation to create a stack based on the template, which will provision the defined resources.

17. Describe the benefits of using Amazon Aurora over traditional RDS databases. How does Aurora ensure fault tolerance and scalability?

Answer: Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database that combines the speed and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. Benefits include up to 5 times the performance of MySQL and 3 times the performance of PostgreSQL. Aurora automatically divides your database volume into 10GB segments spread across many disks. Each 10GB chunk of your database volume is replicated six ways, across three Availability Zones. Aurora continuously backs up your data to Amazon S3, and transparently recovers from physical storage failures; instance failover typically takes less than 30 seconds.

18. How can AWS WAF be integrated with AWS services to enhance web application security?

Answer: AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) protects web applications from common web exploits. It can be integrated with Amazon CloudFront (the CDN service) and Application Load Balancer, allowing you to create custom rules that block malicious traffic patterns. This means that you can use AWS WAF to protect both your applications accessed via CloudFront distributions and those accessed directly via an Application Load Balancer.
