# AWS Question 

1. What is AWS Lambda, and how does it fit into a DevOps environment?

Answer: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It fits into a DevOps environment by enabling the execution of functions in response to events, making it valuable for automation, application scaling, and event-driven workflows.

2. Explain the concept of an AWS Lambda function and its key components.

Answer: An AWS Lambda function is a piece of code that is executed in response to an event. Key components include the function code, runtime, handler, execution role, and triggers. The handler is the entry point for the function code, and triggers define what events invoke the function.

3. What are the programming languages and runtimes supported by AWS Lambda, and how do you choose the appropriate runtime for your function?

Answer: AWS Lambda supports various runtimes, including Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, .NET Core, and custom runtimes. You choose the appropriate runtime based on the language you are comfortable with and the specific requirements of your function.

4. How do you deploy and update AWS Lambda functions, and what is the role of versioning and aliases in managing functions?

Answer: You can deploy and update functions using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs. Versioning and aliases allow you to manage different versions of a function and control which version or alias is invoked by other services or applications.

5. Explain the concept of AWS Lambda event sources and provide examples of services that can trigger Lambda functions.

Answer: AWS Lambda event sources are services that invoke Lambda functions in response to events. Examples include Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS, AWS API Gateway, and custom applications using AWS SDKs.

6. What is the significance of AWS Lambda execution roles, and how do you assign and manage permissions for Lambda functions?

Answer: AWS Lambda execution roles define the permissions a function has to interact with AWS services and resources. You assign permissions by attaching an execution role to the function, and you can manage permissions using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.

7. Explain the differences between provisioned concurrency and on-demand concurrency in AWS Lambda. When would you use each?

Answer:
— Provisioned concurrency is a feature that pre-warms function instances to handle traffic spikes. It is useful when you need consistent low-latency response times and control over scaling.
— On-demand concurrency allows Lambda to scale automatically based on incoming requests. It’s suitable for workloads with variable or unpredictable traffic patterns.

8. What is AWS Lambda Layers, and how can they be used to share code and libraries across multiple functions?

Answer: AWS Lambda Layers are a distribution mechanism for libraries, custom runtimes, and other function dependencies. They allow you to manage and share code and resources across multiple functions, reducing duplication and making updates more efficient.

9. Explain the cost model of AWS Lambda, including how you are billed and what factors can affect the cost of running Lambda functions.

Answer: AWS Lambda charges based on the number of requests, compute duration, and memory used. Factors that can affect the cost include function runtime, memory allocation, and the number of requests. Careful configuration can help optimize costs.

10. How can you troubleshoot and monitor AWS Lambda functions, and what AWS services can you use for logging and monitoring Lambda executions?

Answer: You can troubleshoot and monitor Lambda functions using Amazon CloudWatch for logging and metrics, AWS X-Ray for tracing, and AWS CloudTrail for auditing. CloudWatch Logs provide detailed logs for Lambda function executions.

11. Explain the concept of AWS Step Functions and how they can be used in conjunction with Lambda functions to build complex workflows.

Answer: AWS Step Functions allow you to build serverless workflows by coordinating and orchestrating multiple AWS services, including Lambda functions. They provide state management, error handling, and flow control for complex applications and workflows.

12. How do you ensure the security of Lambda functions, and what are best practices for securing function execution, data, and dependencies?

Answer: Best practices for securing Lambda functions include:
— Applying least privilege IAM policies.
— Securing function code and dependencies.
— Encrypting data at rest and in transit.
— Implementing environment variables for sensitive information.
— Regularly updating and monitoring functions for security vulnerabilities.


# Provisioned concurrency

Provisioned Concurrency is a Lambda feature that prepares concurrent execution environments in advance of invocations. Consequently, this can be used to address two issues. First, if expected traffic arrives more quickly than the default burst capacity, Provisioned Concurrency can ensure that your function is available to meet the demand. Second, if you have latency-sensitive workloads that require predictable double-digit millisecond latency, Provisioned Concurrency solves the typical cold start issues associated with default scaling.
